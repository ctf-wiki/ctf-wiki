# RC4



## basic introduction


Designed by Ron Rivest, RSA was originally part of RSA Security and is a patented cryptographic product. It is a byte-oriented stream cipher with a variable key length that is very simple, but it works. The RC4 algorithm is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocol and the WEP/WPA protocol.


## Basic Process


RC4 mainly consists of three processes


- Initialize the S and T arrays.
- Initialize the replacement S.
- Generate a key stream.


### Initializing S and T arrays


The code to initialize S and T is as follows


```c

for i = 0 to 255 do

	S[i] = i

	T[i] = K[i mod keylen])

```

### Initialization replacement S


```c

j = 0

for i = 0 to 255 do 

	j = (j + S[i] + T[i]) (mod 256) 

	swap (S[i], S[j])

```

### Generating a stream key


```c

i = j = 0 

for each message byte b

i = (i + 1) (toward 256)
	j = (j + S[i]) (mod 256)

	swap(S[i], S[j])

	t = (S[i] + S[j]) (mod 256) 

	print S[t]

```

We generally refer to the first two parts as KSA and the last part to PRGA.
