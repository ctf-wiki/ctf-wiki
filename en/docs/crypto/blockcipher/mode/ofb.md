## Advantages and disadvantages


### Advantages


1. Does not have error propagation characteristics.


### Disadvantages

2. Does not have self-synchronization capability.


## Applicable scene


Applicable to some scenarios where the plaintext redundancy is relatively large, such as image encryption and voice encryption.
