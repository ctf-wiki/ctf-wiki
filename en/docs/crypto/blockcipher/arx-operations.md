# Add-Rotate-Xor



## Overview


The ARX operation is a general term for the following three basic operations.
- Add Modification on the finite field
- Rotate circular shift
- Xor XOR


There are many common block cipher algorithms that use only these three basic operations in a round function. Typical examples are Salsa20, Speck, and so on. In addition, [IDEA] (./idea.md) also uses a similar basic operation to construct the encryption and decryption operation, but replaces the shift by multiplication.


## Advantages and disadvantages


### Advantages


- Easy operation and fast operation
- Execution time is constant to avoid time-based channel attack
- The combined function is sufficiently expressive (see example below)


### Disadvantages


- Among the three basic operations, Rotate and Xor are completely linear operations for a single bit, which may cause some vulnerability (see [Rotational cryptanalysis] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Rotational_cryptanalysis))

#### Analysis


This problem requires us to combine a certain number of Add-Rotate-Xor operations, so that the obtained encryption algorithm can encrypt the fixed plaintext into a specified random ciphertext, that is, construct an arbitrary permutation function through the basic operation. The flag is obtained after 3 successful builds.


#### Problem Solving


For the operation under modulo 256, a typical ARX-based transposition operation can be expressed as the following combination
```

RotateLeft_1(Add_255(RotateLeft_7(Add_2(x))))

```



The above function corresponds to a permutation operation that swaps 254 and 255 while keeping other numbers unchanged.


Intuitively, since the carry occurs in the modulo plus 2 operation of the first step, only the input is 254, 255, the combined function can treat this situation differently.


Using the above atomic operations, we can construct a permutation of any two numbers &#39;a, b`. Combined with the Xor operation, we can reduce the number of basic operations required to meet the limitations given by the title. One possible operational step is as follows:


1. For `a, b`, make `a` 0 by modular operation
2. Move to the right by making the lowest bit of b
3. If `b` is not 1, perform the `Xor 1, Add 255` operation, keeping `a` still 0 and decreasing the value of `b`
4. Repeat operation 2-3 until `b` is 1
5. Perform `Add 254` and transposition operations, exchanging `a, b`
6. For all operations except transposition, add the corresponding inverse operation to ensure that the values other than `a, b` are unchanged.
