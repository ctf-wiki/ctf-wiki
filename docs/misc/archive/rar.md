## file format


The RAR file is mainly composed of a mark block, a compressed file header block, a file header block, and a trailing block.


Each of its blocks is roughly divided into the following fields:


| Name | Size | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | --------------------- |
| HEAD_CRC | 2 | CRC for all blocks or block parts |
| HEAD_TYPE | 1 | Block Type |
| HEAD_FLAGS | 2 | Blocking Flags |
| HEAD_SIZE | 2 | Block Size |
| ADD_SIZE | 4 | Optional Fields - Add Block Size |


The file header of the Rar archive is `0x 52 61 72 21 1A 07 00`.


Following the file header (0x526172211A0700) is the marker block (MARK_HEAD) followed by the File Header.

The end of each RAR file is fixed (Terminator).


| Field Name | Size (bytes) | Possibilities       |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| HEAD_CRC   | 2            | Always 0x3DC4       |
| HEAD_TYPE  | 1            | Header type: 0x7b   |
| HEAD_FLAGS | 2            | Always 0x4000       |
| HEAD_SIZE  | 2            | Block size = 0x0007 |

## Main attack


### Blasting


- [RarCrack] under Linux (http://rarcrack.sourceforge.net/)


### Pseudo encryption


The pseudo-encryption of the RAR file is visible on the bit-marker field in the header of the file. This bit can be clearly seen with the 010 Editor. Modifying this bit can cause pseudo-encryption.

The rest of the plaintext attacks are still the same as those described in the ZIP.
