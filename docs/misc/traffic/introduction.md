## Traffic Packet Analysis


In the CTF competition, forensic analysis of traffic packets is another important direction of investigation.


Usually, a PCAP file containing traffic data is provided during the game, and sometimes the player is required to repair or reconstruct the transferred file before analyzing.


The PCAP section focuses on the direction of the investigation. The complicated part is that the data packet is filled with a large amount of irrelevant traffic information. Therefore, how to classify and filter the data is the work that the entrant needs to complete.


In general, there are the following steps


- Overall grasp
