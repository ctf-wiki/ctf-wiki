A network protocol is a collection of rules, standards, or conventions established for data exchange in a computer network. For example, a computer user in the network communicates with an operator of a mainframe. Since the character sets used by the two data terminals are different, the commands entered by the operator are not known to each other. In order to communicate, it is stipulated that each terminal first converts the characters in the respective character sets into the characters of the standard character set, and then enters the network transmission, and after reaching the destination terminal, it is converted into the character of the terminal character set. Of course, for incompatible terminals, in addition to changing the character set characters, other characteristics, such as display format, line length, number of lines, and screen scrolling mode, need to be converted accordingly.


Correspondingly, in the chapter on protocol analysis, we will introduce this part of the knowledge from the following aspects:

- `HTTP` protocol analysis
- `HTTPS` protocol analysis
- `FTP` protocol analysis
- `DNS` protocol analysis
- `WIFI` protocol analysis
- `USB` protocol analysis
