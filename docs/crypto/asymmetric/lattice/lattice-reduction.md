### basic introduction


The LLL algorithm is to find a set of bases on the lattice, which satisfies the following effects.

Moreover, the following properties of the base generated by this method are very useful.

### Simple application


Here I will give a second example from LLL paper. Given n real numbers $\alpha_i,...,\alpha_n$, find the rational linear approximation of the n numbers, ie find n numbers $m_i$, so that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n }m_i\alpha_i$ is equal to 0 as much as possible. We can construct a matrix like this, where $a_i$ is a rational approximation of $\alpha_i$.




$$ A = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1   & 0 & 0     & \cdots & 0 & ca_1     \\ 0   & 1  & 0    & \cdots & 0 & c a_2  \\ 0   & 0   & 1   & \cdots & 0 & c a_3 \\\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0   & 0   &0   & \cdots & 1 & c a_n     \\ \end{matrix} \right]$$



The matrix is n*(n+1), we can find the determinant corresponding to this lattice according to the method of finding the determinant.


$ Det (L) = \ sqrt {AA} $ ^ T


We further consider such a matrix


$$ A = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1   & 0 & 0     & \cdots & 0 & a_1     \\ 0   & 1  & 0    & \cdots & 0 & a_2  \\ 0   & 0   & 1   & \cdots & 0 & a_3 \\\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0   & 0   &0   & \cdots & 1 & a_n     \\ \end{matrix} \right]$$



Then


$$ AA^T = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1+a_1^2   & a_1a_2   & a_1a_3 & \cdots  & a_1a_n     \\ a_2a_1   & 1+a_2^2  & a_2a_3 & \cdots & a_2a_n  \\ a_3a_1   & a_3a_2   & 1+a_3^2   & \cdots  & a_3a_n \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_na_1   & a_na_2   &a_na_3   & \cdots  & 1+a_n^2     \\ \end{matrix} \right]$$



Further, let&#39;s try it from low-dimensional to high-dimensional (strictly prove that you can consider adding a row and a column, the upper left corner is 1), and the determinant of the lattice is


$\sqrt{1+\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\alpha_i^2}$



Can refer to the following proof of the postgraduate Yuge


![](figure/lll-application2.png)



Then after the LLL algorithm, we can get


$||b_1|| \leq 2^{\frac{n-1}{4}} (1+\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\alpha_i^2)^{\frac{1}{2(n+1)}}$



In general, the latter item tends to 1 when it is opened n times, because $a_i$ is a constant and is generally not related to n, so


$||b_1|| \leq 2^{\frac{n-1}{4}}*k$



k is relatively small. In addition, $b_1$ is a linear combination of the original vectors, then


$b_1[n]=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}m_ic*a_i=c\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}m_i*a_i$



Obviously if c is large enough, then the subsequent summation must be small enough to satisfy the above constraints.
