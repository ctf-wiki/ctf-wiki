# Public Blockchain Security Overview

## 定义

> A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol). Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

> Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.   ------  from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#Public_blockchains)
