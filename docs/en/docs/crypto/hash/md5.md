# MD5



## Basic description


The input and output of MD5 are as follows


- Input: Any long message, 512-bit long packet.
- Output: 128-bit message digest.


For a detailed introduction, please search for yourself.


In addition, sometimes the md5 we get is 16-bit. In fact, the 16-bit is the length of the 32-bit md5, which is derived from the 32-bit md5 value. It is to remove the first eight bits of 32-bit md5 and get the last eight bits.


In general, we can determine whether it is an MD5 function by initializing the function. In general, if a function has the following four initialized variables, you can guess that the function is an MD5 function, because this is the initialization IV of the MD5 function.
